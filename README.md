### [Globe Bar Plots](https://github.com/tashapiro/tanya-data-viz/tree/main/globe-bar-plot)

Inspiration for the Globe Bar plot came from [R Graph Gallery's tutorial](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/circular-barplot.html) on circular bar plots. Used the tutorial to generate the bar plot, then overlayed a choropleth map (in the styel of a globe) in the center. Created using ggplot2.
